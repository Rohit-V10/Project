Mission was to "Hack the Cost Of Living"
Keeping in mind the cost of living crisis, how could we help people and make services.
Me and my team, had focused on making a budget tracker that would give information to user depending on their Credit Score
Built a program, to print out their current utility bill with breakdown of (Gas, Electricity and Water) AND how they could   try and achieve their ideal utility bill for the month inputed into the system.
Use the Trello Kanban Board on division of tasks and user stories
